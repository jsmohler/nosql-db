In addition to the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE method with various arguments, the CouchDB HTTP API also lists the HEAD and COPY methods.  

HEAD - Gets the HTTP header of a GET request but without the body of the response

Ex. 
curl -i -XHEAD "${COUCH_ROOT_URL}/music"

COPY - Copies documents and objects (documents copied depend on the arguments that follow)

Ex. 
curl -i -XCOPY "${COUCH_ROOT_URL}/music/put_id" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Destination: put_id_copy"
