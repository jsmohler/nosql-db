I created a table for employees that has the following structure:

Row key		personal data				professional data
empID		name		city			desgnation	salary
1		Victoria	Denver			Manager		100000
2		Emily		Greenwood Village	Marketing VP	100000


To delete an individual column value in a row I performed the following command:

	delete 'emp', '1', 'professional data:designation'

This deleted the designation cell under the professional data column family for row with key 1 in the emp table.  

To delete an entire row I performed the following command:

	deleteall 'emp', '2'

This deleted the row with row key 2 in the emp table
