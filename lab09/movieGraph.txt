The first step in the movie-graph demo is to create the movie graph using a code block provided by the demo.

The second step in the demo is to run queries for individual nodes on the graph we created in the previous step. The queries included:
 (1) finding Tom Hanks
 (2) finding movies with the title "Cloud Atlas"
 (3) finding 10 people
 (4) finding movies released in the 1990s.

The third step was running queries to find patterns within the graph. The queries included:
 (1) finding all Tom Hanks movies (which makes a very pretty flower-like graph)
 (2) finding who directed "Cloud Atlas"
 (3) finding Tom Hanks' co-actors
 (4) finding how people are related to "Cloud Atlas"   

The fourth step in the demo involved finding the distances between nodes. These included:
 (1) finding all movies and actors up to 4 "hops" away from Kevin Bacon
 (2) finding the shortest path from Kevin Bacon to Meg Ryan (4 total hops: Kevin Bacon -> Apollo 13 -> Tom Hanks -> Sleepless in Seattle -> Meg Ryan)

The fifth step was to make recommendations for new co-actors for Tom Hanks based off of the movie-graph. This included:
 (1) finding the co-workers of Tom Hanks' co-workers, or rather, finding Tom Hanks' co-co-workers
 (2) finding someone to introduce Tom Hanks to Tom Cruise

The sixth and final step of the demo was to clean up by deleting the movie and person nodes and all their relationships, then double-checking that everything is clean.
