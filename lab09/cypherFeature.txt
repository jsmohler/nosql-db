A pretty interesting command is the UNION function which can return the union of a query.  In using relational databases, this feature has been very helpful and so it seems like a great built in utility for a NoSQL database like Neo4j. 

Example of use for UNION (from documentation):

MATCH (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b)
RETURN b.name
UNION
MATCH (a)-[:LOVES]->(b)
RETURN b.name
