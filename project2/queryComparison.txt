AND pdmap.patientID = '124'
AND pitmap.patientID = '124'
AND doctors.doctorID = pdmap.doctorID;

SELECT * FROM patients, doctors, pdmap, pitmap
WHERE patients.patientID = '222' 
AND pdmap.patientID = '222'
AND pitmap.patientID = '222'
AND doctors.doctorID = pdmap.doctorID;

SELECT * FROM patients, doctors, pdmap, pitmap
