Once I inserted 50,000 orders into the orders table, I queried that table 25 times by rec_name (once for each recipe). 

The EXPLAIN results for these non-indexed queries can be seen in 'NonIndexedQueries.txt' and for the indexed queries can be seen in 'IndexedQueries.txt'.  

EXPLAIN measures COST in units of disk page fetches.

The ESTIMATED STARTUP COST and ESTIMATED TOTAL COST for each non-indexed query was 0.0 and 825.24, respectively.  

The ESTIMATED STARTUP COST and ESTIMATED TOTAL COST for each indexed query averaged approximately 39.92 and 361.62, respectively.  

Comparing the ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTs for indexed versus non-indexed queries, there's an average of 464 disk page fetches per query!  Thus, it's quite obvious that indexing rec_name on the orders table will improve query performance significantly if querying by recipe.
