CouchDB has 3 native reduce functions: 
(1) _sum -- sums the emitted values (must be numbers)
	Benefit: super practical function with lots of use cases.
(2) _count -- counts number of emitted values (can be any type)
	Benefit: flexibility with the value type -- can be used for many scenarios
(3) _stats -- calculates numerical statistics on emitted values (must be numbers): current, description, max, mean, min, stddev, and sum. 
	Benefit: provides very useful stats "out of the box"

Benefits: these functions are already written and tested which a) reduces work load and b) guarantees accurate performance (obviously with correct implementation). Also, since they are native to couchDB, the functions aren't specific to a certain database or implementation (increase flexibility).
